# About

Tiles is an inventor toolkit üí° for creative people, students and non-experts to play, learn and ideate human-centric Internet of Things inventions, while having fun.

Tiles proposes the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals as design scenarios.

This repository contains the source PDF files for the Tiles IoT Inventor Toolkit. You can print the PDFs on a regular A4 color printer.


# Tranlsation

Translations for English üá∫üá∏ (en_US) and Norwegian Bokm√•l üá≥üá¥ (nb_NO) are complete and available. You can contribute translating the toolkit in your language, see [tilestoolkit/tiles-iot-inventor-toolkit-i18n](https://github.com/tilestoolkit/tiles-iot-inventor-toolkit-i18n).


# Cards

Become an IoT inventor! It's now as easy as playing a card game:

‚ö°Ô∏è Technology cards  provide the basic ingredients for designing smart objects: including everyday things and places, internet services and sensors, human's actions and interactive feedback.

üéØ Missions cards unleash your inner inventor, skyrocketing your creativity with fun and provocative design quests.

üëì Criteria cards bring you back down to earth, helping you reflect and prove your ideas.

# Play

‚öîÔ∏è Multi play mode  when you use the cards together with the Tiles Inventor Board ‚å®Ô∏é you can arrange hackathon-style Tiles Workshops, where multiple teams invent IoT solutions to solve given societal challenges (e.g. climate change, waste reduction, participation in social life); combining cards play with design thinking activities. Tiles workshops are also great ways for young students to learn the basic of design and computational thinking üëæ.

## Tiles IoT Inventor Workshop

While the Tiles IoT Inventor Cards are great for brainstorming sessions, we have designed a workshop experience for teams of inventors ü§ì. The Tiles IoT Inventor Workshop is a great way to learn the foundations of IoT and design thinking while ideating an IoT invention to solve the Sustainable Development Goals from the UN (e.g. climate change üå™, waste reduction ‚ôªÔ∏è, social segregation).

During a 1-hour ‚è∞ workshop, participants fast-pace through a set of 6 design thinking üß† activities: explore üëÄ, challenge ‚öîÔ∏è, combine ü•ò, sketch ‚úèÔ∏è, refine üîú and pitch üé§ to collaboratively converge towards an IoT invention idea üí•. The outcome of the workshop is a storyboard and an elevator pitch ready to be used to drive prototyping actions ü•Ω, collaborative discussion and reflection.
